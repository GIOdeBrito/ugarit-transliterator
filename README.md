# Ugarit Transliterator

This is one of my favourite projects, the Ugarit Transliterator.
Where I aim to create a tool to help understand, and record, the long forgotten ugaritic language.

## Requirements

- A Linux-running machine (Preferably)
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Run: step-by-step

Build the images with ``docker composer``.

```bash
sudo docker-compose build
```

Bring up the containers, or update them.

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
